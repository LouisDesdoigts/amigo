# AMIGO

Aperture Masking Interferometry Generative Observations for JWST.

---

This repo is currently under development and subject to change.

Much of the code is eventually be split into either dLux (ie the interferometry.py file) or Zodiax (most of the fitting.py and FIM.py files).

The amgio pipeline requires _custom file processing_, which is covered by the pipelines.py file. More details on this later.

To see example usage of the pipeline, see the [amigo_notebooks](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/amigo_notebooks) repo. It is currently private, so just message me for access.

Note for model initialisation (not in the package presently, but done in th notebooks) you will need to clone and install [xara](https://github.com/fmartinache/xara) locally.

And never forget, AMI go brrrrrrrr
